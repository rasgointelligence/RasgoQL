### ------------
# Note to users:
# This module is used to allow rasgoql to install the minimum dependencies
# needed to run your flavor of DataWarehouse

# We support downloading extas packages for each DW: e.g. `rasgoql[snowflake]`
# so your machine is not cluttered with unused google or sqlalchemy packages.
# In doing so, we run the risk of not having required dependencies at runtime

# This module attempts to import all possible datawarehouse packages, and
# fails gracefully if they are not present
# RasgoQL will use these empty aliases to raise a PackageDependencyWarning
# from the class or function that needs the import
